# React Spring - useTrail

This repository contains a React application leveraging the React Three Fiber (R3F) library for 3D rendering in the browser.
The scene utilizes useTrail from React Spring to create animations with a trail effect.

# Libraries and Components Used:

@react-three/drei: This library provides useful abstractions and components for working with R3F, 

such as OrbitControls for easy camera manipulation and Text for rendering text in the 3D scene.

@react-spring/three: This library integrates React Spring animations with R3F. useTrail is employed here to create staggered animations for multiple elements.

# Code Overview:

Scene Component: The Scene component serves as the main entry point. It sets up the 3D environment, including camera controls with OrbitControls. Within this component, useTrail is utilized to animate a series of mesh elements.

Mesh Elements: Mesh elements are created using a.mesh from React Spring. Each mesh is associated with an animation defined by useTrail.

# useTrail Properties:

from: Defines the initial state of the animation. In this code, from: { scale: 0 } indicates that the initial scale of the meshes is 0.

to: Specifies the target state of the animation. Here, to: { scale: 0.6 } means that the meshes will scale up to 0.6 when animated.

# Interaction:

Pointer Events: The onPointerMissed event handler is attached to each mesh element. When a pointer event is missed (e.g., when a user hovers over the mesh), the missedHandler function is triggered, toggling the animation between scaling up and down
